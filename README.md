This repository contains my presentation for the Kaggle Competitions Group of the Vancouver Data Science meetup about the 2020 Cornell Birdcall Identification competition.

The idea of the presentation is to review the competition and the techniques used by the winners in order to advance understanding of these topics.

The video of my talk can be found here.
